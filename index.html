                    The early years of this century saw some aspiring students garner 
                    around in the hope to behold the seeds of ideas that sprouted in their 
                    minds take life before them. This resulted in one of south India's biggest 
                    scholastic endeavors - Tathva, the techno-management fest of NIT Calicut. 
                    Since it's inception in 2000, this annual symposium has known only growth,
                     and has flourished into one of the few promising enterprises the nation has witnessed.

                    Pushing the barriers year after year, Tathva aims at providing a plethora of platforms 
                    to the intrigued technical heads that arrive at this fiesta with an array of events and 
                    workshops, to sharpen their skills and widen their knowledge quotient. With the engine up and roaring, Tathva'19 is all set to embark on a new expedition, proffering opportunities and paving trails to greater comprehension. From being in awe of the top-notch robotic & automobile display and the adrenaline rush while racing against time and competing with some of the tech-wired geniuses out there, to the ecstatic ambience of the pronites, Tathva has it all covered for it's audience. With Adizya displaying an impressive arena for the art lovers and designing heads, we call out to all the right and left brains alike. Come, embark on this journey with us, 
                    and let's drift away from normalcy and let the magic seep into our souls.
